# Implementing Neural Networks from Scratch

A project I undertook to better understand the fundamentals of Deep Learning. I worked on this alongside Andrew Ngâ€™s Deep Learning course, which provided a strong theoretical foundation. In this project, I implemented a neural network using only base Python and NumPy (with some scikit-learn for data handling, but not for the network itself). Through this, I achieved 96% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

This experience was highly insightful and included integrating several techniques to improve performance and deepen my understanding of core concepts like forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization.
